# Image Stitching and Feature Detection

## Project Overview
This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the process of detecting image features, matching them across multiple images, and creating a panorama by stitching the images together. The project includes tasks on loading images, detecting feature points, extracting local neighborhoods, computing distances, selecting matches, applying RANSAC for robust matching, warping images, and creating a panorama.

## Files in the Repository
- **Image_Stitching_and_Feature_Detection.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code and explanations for the various tasks performed in the project.
- Image files required for the analysis (ensure to include them in the repository if necessary).

## How to Use

   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python scipy
   ```

3. **Running the Notebook**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook Image_Stitching_and_Feature_Detection.ipynb
     ```
   - Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the various tasks and analyses.

## Sections in the Notebook

### 1. Load Images and Convert to Grayscale
#### Description:
Load the images to be stitched and convert them to grayscale for feature detection.
#### Key Steps:
   - Load the images using OpenCV.
   - Convert the images to grayscale.

### 2. Detect Feature Points
#### Description:
Detect feature points in the images using a feature detection algorithm.
#### Key Steps:
   - Use a feature detection method (e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB) to detect keypoints in the images.
   - Visualize the detected keypoints.

### 3. Extract Local Neighborhoods around Every Keypoint
#### Description:
Extract local neighborhoods (descriptors) around each keypoint for matching.
#### Key Steps:
   - Extract descriptors for each keypoint using the chosen feature detection method.

### 4. Compute Distances between Descriptors
#### Description:
Compute distances between descriptors from different images to find potential matches.
#### Key Steps:
   - Use a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) to compute distances between descriptors.

### 5. Select Matches
#### Description:
Select the best matches between descriptors from different images.
#### Key Steps:
   - Apply a matching algorithm (e.g., nearest-neighbor, FLANN) to find the best matches.
   - Visualize the selected matches.

### 6. RANSAC
#### Description:
Apply RANSAC to remove outliers and find a robust transformation between images.
#### Key Steps:
   - Use RANSAC to estimate a homography matrix between the images.
   - Visualize the inliers and outliers.

### 7. Warp One Image onto the Other
#### Description:
Warp one image onto the coordinate system of the other using the estimated homography.
#### Key Steps:
   - Apply the homography to warp one image.
   - Visualize the warped image.

### 8. Create a New Image to Hold the Panorama
#### Description:
Create a new image that combines the warped images into a panorama.
#### Key Steps:
   - Combine the images into a single panoramic image.
   - Visualize the final panorama.

## Visualization
The notebook includes various visualizations to support the analysis, such as keypoint detection, descriptor matching, RANSAC inliers and outliers, and the final panoramic image. Each section's visualizations help in understanding the data and the results of the applied techniques.

## Conclusion
This notebook provides a comprehensive approach to image feature detection, matching, and stitching to create a panorama. By following the steps in the notebook, users can replicate the analyses on similar images or extend them to other image processing tasks.
